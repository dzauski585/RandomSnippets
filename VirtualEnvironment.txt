Flask

flask run ((((in comand line))))

oooorrrrrr see below:

Start virtual Environment:
    py -3 -m venv .venv

    .venv\scripts\activate

Install Flask into virtual Environment
python -m pip install flask

Go to view command pallete at top of VS code
    Python select interpretor
        Select at workspace level
            Star option

python -m flask Run


Seems to deactivate venv by deleting the files...?
